    description: `The breath of truth after confusion breaks.
clarity • truth • awakening
Ahura walks barefoot in blinding light, not
to blind but to burn illusion. His crown is
simple, no gold, no gems, only truth.
This card is a call to rise with clarity, not
ego. It asks if you’re ready to lose comfort for
absolute truth.`,

    description: `The instant hesitation dies.
courage • action • force
Ares is not strategy. He is the raw fire beneath
what you silence. His form curves like two
forces in collision, not enemies but truth
confronting itself. The red isn’t just for blood.
It’s for life refusing to stay numb.`,

    description: `The silent structure behind enduring things.
legacy • vision • endurance

Asgard is not just a sky kingdom, but a memory of who you were before pain changed you. Its
shape is a roof, rising like a shelter built inside you. This card is about return, not to the past but
to the self before the world made you forget.`,

    description: `The hidden current beneath survival.
wisdom • adaptation • intelligence
He has no edges, only movement. Like water, he solves without force. His form is a circle, with a
line inside, calm outside, creation within. Enki doesn’t repair. He begins again, without fear,
without shame.`,

grounding • patience • life
She holds life in her curve, not just one child but the memory of all birth. Her green form is
shelter, womb, and earth itself. Gaia is where everything begins and where everything longs to
return.`,

sovereignty • dignity • presence
One side holds color. The other reveals it. Together they don’t merge. They define each other.
Hera is the space between union and distance, the birth of language and law.`,

balance • softness • flow
Laozi sits by a river and says nothing, but somehow changes everything. His shape holds a
quiet fire, and a small window through which another world can be seen. This card suggests
that stillness, not action, brings transformation.`,

trust • memory • bond
In ancient Persia, Mitra watched over promises, not through power but presence. A circle and a
square, different in every way but joined at one point. That one point is not sameness. It’s
friendship. He sees who stays loyal even when no one is watching.`,

    description: `The revelation that changes everything once seen.
illusion • discovery • insight
Setna is the illusionist who once fooled death. His shape feels balanced, but only from one
angle. Spin it and what seemed real begins to twist. This card asks what masks do you wear,
and who would you be without them.`,

intuition • vision • listening
Shaman appears in black because he carries the others. Eleven colours from the other symbols
sit inside him, silent but alive. His shape pulls you inward, as if he already knows what you're
hiding. He doesn’t walk the path. He is where it begins.`,

release • transformation • renewal
Shiva dances where things fall apart, not to end them but to set them free. His shape is a third
eye, closed to the world but open to truth. This card marks the end of what you’ve outgrown.
Step into the fire. See what stays.`,

strength • burden • ambition
Titan is the rebel who lost everything but still stood tall. His power is not in size, but in refusal to
kneel. Pulling Titan means you're being asked to stop apologizing for being too much. Be
thunder. Own it.`,
